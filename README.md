Overview of the Project

Objective: Develop a simple application that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input for height and weight. The application provides users with their BMI value and categorizes it into predefined weight categories.

Features:

User Input: Users can enter their height in centimeters and weight in kilograms through a graphical user interface (GUI).
BMI Calculation: The application calculates BMI using the formula:

BMI = weight (kg)/height (m)^2
​
where height is converted from centimeters to meters.
BMI Categorization: Based on the calculated BMI, the app categorizes the user's weight as:
Underweight
Normal weight
Overweight
Obesity

Error Handling: The application includes error handling to ensure that inputs are valid and positive.

User Interface:

Platform: The application is developed using Python's tkinter module, providing a simple and intuitive GUI.
Components: It includes input fields for height and weight, a button to calculate BMI, and messages displaying the result and category.
Implementation:

Language Used: Python
Modules Used: The app utilizes tkinter for creating the GUI and messagebox for displaying results and error messages.
Known Limitations:

The application assumes height and weight are input in metric units (centimeters and kilograms).
It does not store or track historical BMI data.
Potential Enhancements:

Add support for imperial units (inches and pounds).
Incorporate user profiles to track BMI over time.
Provide additional health tips based on BMI results.
This project serves as a foundational tool for calculating BMI and understanding its implications for health, making it a useful utility for individuals looking to monitor their weight status.
